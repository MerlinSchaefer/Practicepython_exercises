# Practicepython_exercises
My solutions to the Practicepython.org challenges which I used in the beginning of my Python journey to practice

These solutions are my own and sometimes differ from the ones proposed on the website.
They usually also include the extra-tasks to the exercises
This code was written as I was still learning python.
Any criticism/hints to make it more concise/pythonic is welcome.
