"""
Letâ€™s continue building Hangman. In the game of Hangman, 
a clue word is given by the program that the player has to guess, 
letter by letter. 
The player guesses one letter at a time until the entire word has 
been guessed. 
(In the actual game, the player can only guess 6 letters incorrectly before losing).

For this exercise, write the logic that asks a player to guess a letter and displays 
letters in the clue word that were guessed correctly. For now, let the player guess 
an infinite number of times until they get the entire word. 
As a bonus, keep track of the letters the player guessed and 
display a different message if the player tries to guess that 
letter again. 
Remember to stop the game when all the letters have been guessed correctly!
