"""
If a game of Tic Tac Toe is represented as a list of lists, like so:

game = [[1, 2, 0],
	[2, 1, 0],
	[2, 1, 1]]
where a 0 means an empty square, a 1 means that player 1 put their token in that space, 
and a 2 means that player 2 put their token in that space.

Your task this week: given a 3 by 3 list of lists that represents 
a Tic Tac Toe game board, tell me whether anyone has won, and tell 
me which player won, if any. 
A Tic Tac Toe win is 3 in a row - either in a row, 
a column, or a diagonal. 
Donâ€™t worry about the case where TWO people have won - 
assume that in every board there will only be one winner.
