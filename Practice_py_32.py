"""
In this exercise, we will finish building Hangman.
In the game of Hangman, the player only has 6 incorrect guesses (head, body, 2 legs, and 2 arms) before they lose the game.

Copy your code from Parts 1 and 2 into a new file as a starting point. Now add the following features:

Only let the user guess 6 times, and tell the user how many guesses they have left.
Keep track of the letters the user guessed. If the user guesses a letter they already guessed, donâ€™t penalize them - let them guess again.
